# DevOps

Devops is a culture. It's the union of Development and Operations. DevOps aim to deliver **automatization** and **autoservice** to the final users of the product delivered by a DevOps team. The DevOps principles are:

## Principles

| principle | comments | 
| --- | --- | 
| Customer-centric action | The better I know my cliente, the better will be the solutions I deliver to them. |
| Create with an end in mind | Always think as a product. Even a 10 line script can generate tons of dolars. If I don't think it as a product, how can it be functional 5 years ahead? |
| End-to-end responsibility | Me and my team are responsible for the whole thing. Forget the time when I would develop something and handover to support teams to keep it running. |
| Cross-functional autonomus teams | Many specialties in my team to make end-to-end responsibility possible. |
| Continuos improvement | Improve to keep delivering best solution to my customer. |
| Automate everything you can | Doing this I can focus on what is important and to scale my product. |

- Culture
